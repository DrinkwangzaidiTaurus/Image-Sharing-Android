## Abstract

This project introduces SharePictures, a photo-sharing application developed using Android Studio and managed on GitHub. It relies on Alibaba Cloud as its data source. The app presents images and accompanying messages in a list format, displaying user avatars, nicknames, and other information. Users can engage in functionalities such as liking and sharing photos. SharePictures is designed to meet a wide range of application requirements, including account registration, login, viewing dynamic image feeds, liking, sharing, downloading, publishing personal image information, and user management.

Users can use SharePictures to share their life moments, showcasing their exciting experiences to others. Additionally, users can appreciate dynamic image feeds shared by friends or other users. If a user likes a particular image, they can express it through liking or share it on their social media. Users can view the number of likes on images and zoom in on pictures. In the personal information section, users can see a collection of images they liked and shared. SharePictures even allows users to create multiple accounts for better control over the app.
